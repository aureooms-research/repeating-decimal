"""

An integer that is not co-prime to 10 but has a prime factor other than 2 or 5
has a reciprocal that is eventually periodic, but with a non-repeating sequence
of digits that precede the repeating part. The reciprocal can be expressed as:

    \frac{1}{2^a 5^b p^k q^\ell \cdots}\, ,

where a and b are not both zero.

This fraction can also be expressed as:

    \frac{5^{a-b}}{10^a p^k q^\ell \cdots}\, ,

if a > b, or as

    \frac{2^{b-a}}{10^b p^k q^\ell \cdots}\, ,

if b > a, or as

    \frac{1}{10^a p^k q^\ell \cdots}\, ,

if a = b.

The decimal has:

	An initial transient of max(a, b) digits after the decimal point. Some or
	all of the digits in the transient can be zeros.
	A subsequent repetend which is the same as that for the fraction
	\frac{1}{p^k q^\ell \cdots}.

For example 1/28 = 0.03571428571428â€¦:

    the initial non-repeating digits are 03; and
    the subsequent repeating digits are 571428.
